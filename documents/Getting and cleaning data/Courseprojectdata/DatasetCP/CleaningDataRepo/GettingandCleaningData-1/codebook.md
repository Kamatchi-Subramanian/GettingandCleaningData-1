This is the code book for explaining the output.txt file. 
The first two columns are the subject_id and activity_id. There are 30 subjects (1 to 30) and each of them do 6 activities. 
That is why we have 180 rows. 
As to the variables that were measured, we have tBodyAccmeanX which is the mean Body Acceleration in X axis. Similarly for Y and Z we have tBodyAccmeanY
and tBodyAccmeanZ.
